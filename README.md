## Usage

### ⚡️ Workflow Example

Example below shows the minimal workflow setup and all the optional inputs for the action (set to theirs default values). If you are happy with the output generated by the action, it's safe to remove all optional inputs.

```yml
name: Yarn Lock Changes
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  yarn_lock_changes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Permission overwrite is required for Dependabot PRs, see "Common issues" below
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Please use `main` as version before the stable release will be published as `v1`
      - name: Yarn Lock Changes
        uses: Simek/yarn-lock-changes@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Optional inputs, can be deleted safely if you are happy with default values
          collapsibleThreshold: 25
          failOnDowngrade: false
          path: yarn.lock
          updateComment: true
```

### 🔌 Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `collapsibleThreshold` | No | `25` | Number of lock changes, which will result in collapsed comment content and an addition of changes summary table. |
| `failOnDowngrade` | No | `false` | When a dependency downgrade is detected, fail the action. __Comment will still be posted.__ |
| `path` | No | `yarn.lock` | Path to the `yarn.lock` file in the repository. Default value points to the file at project root. |
| `token` | <ins>**Yes**</ins> | – | Repository `GITHUB_TOKEN` which allows action to make calls to the GitHub API (Octokit). |
| `updateComment` | No | `true` | Update the comment on each new commit. If value is set to `false`, bot will post a new comment on each change. |

## 📋 Common issues

### The action fails on the Dependabot pull requests

Due to the security reasons from March 1st, 2021 workflow runs that are triggered by Dependabot have permissions reduced by default: 

* [GitHub Actions: Workflows triggered by Dependabot PRs will run with read-only permissions](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-19-github-actions-workflows-triggered-by-dependabot-prs-will-run-with-read-only-permissions/)

To ensure that sufficient permissions for this action are always granted, you will need to add `permissions` entry to the job which runs `yarn-lock-changes`:

```yml
jobs:
  ...:
    runs-on: ...
    #####
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    #####
    steps:
      ...
```

## 🔍️ Debugging

To run action in the debug mode you need to add the `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` repository secret set to `true`, as stated in the GitHub documentation:
* https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/enabling-debug-logging#enabling-runner-diagnostic-logging

Then additional information will be available in the action [downloadable log](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/using-workflow-run-logs#downloading-logs), which might be useful when debugging the issue.
